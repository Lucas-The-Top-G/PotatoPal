            <div class="text-box">
                <p>We probably all know Google unless you’ve been living under a rock since 1996. Google’s flagship
                    product is its search engine. This is what we will be reviewing. Recently it was found guilty of
                    paying Apple a very large amount of money for it to be the iPhone's default search engine. Hence
                    they are now declared as a monopoly.

                <h3 data-color="green">Strengths</h3>
                <h4><u>Huge Index of Web Pages</u></h4>
                <p>
                    Being a search engine requires that you have web pages that people want to see. This is probably
                    simpleish. As we could start at any Wikipedia webpage, and save the contents of the page. Then go to
                    every site that that Wikipedia page references and repeat. This works until it comes to displaying
                    the search results. That would get difficult. But, because Google has a huge index of web pages,
                    they can show you a lot of relevant search results.
                </p>
                <h4><u>Advanced Algorithm</u></h4>
                <p>
                    This is the hard part that I said in the ladder point. To build one like Google’s algorithm would
                    require insane power to train the AI. When searching the web, Google will run this algo on your
                    search and Google account, I assume, and return the results from the search.
                </p>
                <h4><u>Image Search</u></h4>
                <p>
                    Using image search is so fun. For example, you could take a picture of your fridge and it would show
                    relevant and similar models of your fridge. This would be a very hard AI to build without the vast
                    amounts of data that Google has.
                </p>
                <h3 data-color="red">Weaknesses</h3>
                <h4><u>Sells Your Data</u></h4>
                <p>
                    If the product is free. Then you are the product. That quote represents Google’s entire business
                    model. They sell your data to advertisers to make money. They do have other profit centers, like
                    Firestore and Google Cloud, but those aren’t part of the search engine.
                </p>
                <h4><u>It's A Monopoly</u></h4>
                <p>
                    According to a New York Times article, it said that Google is now officially a monopoly. Their
                    consequence is that they have to sell chrome. Their main entrance into their array[], to make an
                    array in C++ you write type[] see what I did there, of products.
                </p>
                <h3>Conclusion For Google</h3>
                <p>
                    I will give Google a 9/10. This is because I use Google Docs quite a bit, and I’m not worried about
                    my data being sold.
